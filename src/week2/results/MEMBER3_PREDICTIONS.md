## 🔬 Scientific Method Approach

### Why Document Predictions First?

1. **Avoid Confirmation Bias:** Write predictions before seeing results
2. **Test Hypothesis:** RFM-based transferability → actual transfer success
3. **Validate Approach:** Does Week 2 methodology predict Week 3 outcomes?
4. **Research Rigor:** This is how real ML research works!

### Week 3 Validation Process:

```
Week 2 (NOW)              Week 3 (LATER)              Week 4 (FINAL)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Calculate RFM    →    2. Run experiments    →    3. Compare results
   transferability        - Train models                - Predicted vs Actual
                          - Transfer models             - Update methodology
2. Make predictions  →    - Measure performance  →    4. Write final report
   (this document)        - Record metrics

## 📚 Methodology Recap

### Week 2: RFM-Based Transferability

We calculated transferability using:

1. **Recency Distribution:** How recently customers purchased
2. **Frequency Distribution:** How often customers purchase
3. **Monetary Distribution:** How much customers spend

**Formula:**
```
Transferability = 1 - KL_Divergence(RFM_source || RFM_target)
```

**Thresholds:**
- **HIGH (≥0.75):** Transfer as-is
- **MODERATE (0.55-0.75):** Fine-tune recommended  
- **LOW (<0.55):** Train new model

### Why RFM?

- ✅ Captures actual customer behavior patterns
- ✅ Directly relevant to segmentation tasks
- ✅ More predictive than product features (see Week 1 vs Week 2 comparison)
- ✅ Industry-standard metric in customer analytics

---

## 🔍 What We're Testing

### Primary Hypothesis:
**"Higher RFM-based transferability scores predict more successful model transfer in customer segmentation tasks."**

### Specific Questions:

1. **Do HIGH scores (≥0.75) lead to successful direct transfer?**
   - Pairs: Cleaning → Foodgrains, Popular → Niche
   
2. **Do MODERATE scores (0.55-0.75) benefit from fine-tuning?**
   - Pair: Premium → Budget
   
3. **Does RFM transferability correlate with clustering quality?**
   - Compare: Predicted vs Actual silhouette scores
   
4. **Is RFM better than product features for prediction?**
   - Compare Week 2 predictions vs Week 1 (if we had Week 1 predictions)

---

## 📊 Validation Checklist (Week 3)

After running experiments, validate each prediction:

- [ ] Record all model performance metrics
- [ ] Compare predicted vs actual outcomes
- [ ] Calculate prediction accuracy
- [ ] Identify where predictions failed (if any)
- [ ] Analyze reasons for prediction errors
- [ ] Update transferability methodology if needed
- [ ] Document lessons learned

---

## 🎓 Expected Insights

### If Predictions are CORRECT:
✅ RFM-based transferability is a valid predictor  
✅ Week 2 methodology works  
✅ Can use this approach for future domain pairs  
✅ Strong evidence for research validity

### If Predictions are INCORRECT:
🔍 Need to revise transferability formula  
🔍 May need additional features beyond RFM  
🔍 Thresholds might need adjustment  
🔍 Still valuable - learned what doesn't work!
