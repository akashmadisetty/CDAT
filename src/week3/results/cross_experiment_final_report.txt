RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. For HIGH transferability pairs (Week 1 score > 0.85):
   ✅ Use transfer as-is (no target data needed)
   ✅ Expected quality: >85% of train-from-scratch
   ✅ Cost savings: Significant (no target labeling needed)

2. For MODERATE transferability pairs (Week 1 score 0.6-0.85):
   ⚠️  Transfer as-is achieves 70-85% quality
   ✅ Fine-tune with 10-20% target data recommended
   ✅ Expected improvement: 5-15%

3. For LOW transferability pairs (Week 1 score < 0.6):
   ❌ Transfer as-is achieves <70% quality
   ⚠️  Heavy fine-tuning (>50%) or train from scratch
   ⚠️  Transfer learning may not be cost-effective

LIMITATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Small sample size (4 domain pairs)
2. Single clustering algorithm tested (K-Means)
3. RFM features only - other features may show different patterns
4. Synthetic customer data - real-world results may vary

FUTURE WORK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Test with more domain pairs to strengthen statistical validation
2. Compare multiple clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, Hierarchical)
3. Explore additional features beyond RFM
4. Validate on real customer transaction data
5. Test other transfer learning techniques (domain adaptation, meta-learning)
