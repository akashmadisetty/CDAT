5,UK → France,3920,87,0.8748919751592701,0.12226587218334017,0.18499303837660977,0.8907554497059876,0.1114825240441004,0.13823851826513625,fine_tune_light,MODERATE,87.6673291312139,15,MODERATE,Moderate transferability (score: 0.8749). Domains share some similarities but have notable differences. Transfer learning is viable but requires fine-tuning with 10-20% of target data to adapt to domain-specific patterns.

Significant differences between domains. Transfer learning may still provide benefit over random initialization, but requires substantial fine-tuning (60-80% target data). Consider comparing with training from scratch."
