They do not undergo any chemical modification and are the result of pressing by stone-press. Uses:- • Frying with olive oil does not raise heart disease risk. • Olive oil helps prevent stroke. • It helps in reducing the levels of obesity. • It improves bone mineralisation and reduce risk of osteoporosis. • Normal blood sugar levels can be kept in check with regular use of olive oil. Extra virgin olive oil is made simply by crushing olives and extracting the juice. It is the only cooking oil that is made without the use of chemicals and industrial refining.
Its simply the juice of fresh, healthy olives which contains, more than any other grade, the health-promoting nutrients that olive oil is famous for. Extra virgin is the highest quality and most expensive olive oil classification. It should have no defects and a flavor of fresh olives.

It must be produced entirely by mechanical means without the use of any solvents, and under temperatures that will not degrade the oil.

5507,Tricolor Toasted Pearl Couscous,Gourmet & World Food,Cooking & Baking Needs,Dolce Vita,157.5,175.0,Quinoa & Grains,,"Although the couscous granules look like grains, couscous is actually tiny ground pasta made from a type of wheat called semolina. Unlike other pasta, which are mixed with water and eggs into sheets, couscous is made by rubbing semolina between wet hands until the miniscule pieces are formed. The couscous is then dried and later cooked in boiling water. Israeli couscous is also a type of pasta, but consists of granules that are much larger about the size of small pearls. Made from wheat flour and semolina, Israeli couscous has a ball-like shape and is toasted, rather than dried, after the granules are formed. This process gives Israeli couscous a nuttier flavour and chewy bite that adds an unexpected touch to regional recipes. We offer Israeli couscous, made in USA, from the finest amber, durum US wheat, thus giving it the premium quality that you can expect. Named for its unique shape, whole wheat pearled couscous (also known as Israeli couscous or pearled pasta) is shaped and rolled into tiny balls and then toasted. This allows the product to absorb liquids and cook up more like rice or risotto. The toasting process also gives this product a nutty flavour and satisfying mouth-feel. Whole Wheat Pearl Couscous is a delicious way to add the nutrition of whole grains to your table. These pearls of toasted flour have a lovely texture and nutty flavour. Just toss with veggies, pesto, pasta sauce, use as a bed for meats or stews, or let it stand alone as a stunning side dish. To prepare it, start by sauteing the couscous in oil. Then add 1 1/4 cups of boiling water and mix the couscous in a pan. Cover and simmer for 8-10 minutes and stir occasionally. Once the water is absorbed, fluff it with a fork and this couscous is ready to serve.

Noodles originated from china, whence they migrated eastwards to japan and westwards to south Asia. No oriental meal can be complete without noodles. Asian wheat noodles are typically made from low-or moderate - protein flours and are formed not by extrusion but by sheeting and cutting or stretching. The hand-pulled noodles of shanghai (la mian) are a fine example, in which the maker starts with a thick rope of dough, swings, twists and stretches it to an arm’s length, brings the ends together, repeats the process as many as 11 times to make more than 4000 thin noodles. Asian wheat noodles are both elastic and soft, their texture created by their weak gluten and amylopectin - rich starch in the wheat. Salt is an important ingredient in Asian noodles. It tightens the gluten network and stabilizes the starch granules, keeping them intact even as they absorb water and swell. We begin with the meishi white wheat Chinese noodles, ban mian style (Hand cut hakka noodles) - both - broad as well as fine. You may prefer the broad noodles for the ban mian soup and the fine noodles for stir-fry with veggies or meat. The ingredients are wheat flour, salt and water.

It is vital to that brown sugars naturally leach colour when dissolved in water since the crystals contain a thin layer of the remaining molasses produced during the manufacturing process.

If you need it immediately, simply place roughly the amount of sugar you need in a microwave-safe bowl with a slightly dampened paper towel on top. Microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute on medium-low, or until it's soft.

10697,Whole Wheat Toasted Pearl Couscous,Gourmet & World Food,Cooking & Baking Needs,Dolce Vita,157.5,175.0,Quinoa & Grains,,"Although the couscous granules look like grains, couscous is actually tiny ground pasta made from a type of wheat called semolina. Unlike other pasta, which is mixed with water and eggs into sheets, couscous is made by rubbing semolina between wet hands until minuscule pieces are formed. The couscous is then dried and later cooked in boiling water. Israeli couscous is also a type of pasta but consists of granules that are much larger about the size of small pearls. Made from wheat flour and semolina, Israeli couscous has a ball-like shape and is toasted, rather than dried, after the granules are formed. This process gives Israeli couscous a nuttier flavour and chewy bite that adds an unexpected touch to regional recipes. We offer Israeli couscous, made in the USA, from the finest amber, durum US wheat, thus giving it the premium quality that you can expect. Named for its unique shape, whole wheat pearled couscous (also known as Israeli couscous or pearled pasta) is shaped and rolled into tiny balls and then toasted. This allows the product to absorb liquids and cook up more like rice or risotto. The toasting process also gives this product a nutty flavour and satisfying mouthfeel. Whole Wheat Pearl Couscous is a delicious way to add the nutrition of whole grains to your table. These pearls of toasted flour have a lovely texture and nutty flavour. Just toss with veggies, pesto, pasta sauce, use as a bed for meats or stews, or let it stand alone as a stunning side dish. To prepare it, start by sauteing the couscous in oil. Then add 1 1/4 cups of boiling water and mix the couscous in a pan. Cover and simmer for 8-10 minutes and stir occasionally. Once the water is absorbed, fluff it with a fork and this couscous is ready to serve.

Dr.Patkars Apple Cider Vinegar can be used in preparation of a number of food dishes, including: 
Salad dressing - Dr. Patkars Apple Cider Vinegar is best used for salad dressing. A concoction of cider vinegar with herbs and spices sprinkled over a salad could do wonders to its taste. Make a quick dressing by mixing olive oil, cider vinegar, a little bit of sugar and herbs.
Sauce / Chutneys - Dr.Patkars Apple Cider Vinegar has a tangy, fruity taste to it and adding it to your sauce and chutneys enhances their flavors. It is best used when making fruit chutneys as it helps soften the fruit when added while cooking. Tomatoes are the most suited for sauce as they themselves are acidic in nature.
Boiled eggs - Add a spoonful of Dr. Patkars Apple Cider Vinegar to the water when boiling hard shell eggs. This will prevent the shells from cracking and letting the whites leak.
Marinate and Tenderizing- Marinating meat in Dr.Patkars Apple Cider Vinegar helps tenderize the meat, and aids in killing the bacteria. In a cup of vinegar, add spices and herb for marination. Let the meat rest in this mix for a few hours or overnight. Your meat will be soft and you will enjoy it. This is the secret formula of many restaurants.
Digestion - To make dried beans/pulses, add Dr. Patkars Apple Cider Vinegar to the soaking water and then cook with vinegar. Vinegar helps to break down cellulose in any fibrous or stringy vegetables which prevents acidity.
How to use for hair care:
Wash your hair with a mild shampoo. After the shampoo is rinsed squeeze hair to remove as much water as possible, Take some Dr.Patkars Apple Cider Vinegar on your palm and gently apply on your hair including scalp. After 6 to 10 minutes, rinse with water.

People with heavy dandruff can apply in the ratio 1:2 with water to their scalp at night before going to bed. The next morning, follow the hair wash process as mentioned above. The vinegar smell vanishes once hair is dried.
How to use for skin care:
Homemade natural toner - Make a toning solution of Apple Cider Vinegar and water in the ratio 1:3 or 1:4. Apply on skin with cotton. For Acne and Pimples, use in ratio of 1:2 on affected area. Rinse after 20 minutes.

Unlike other pasta, which is mixed with water and eggs into sheets, couscous is made by rubbing semolina between wet hands until minuscule pieces are formed. The couscous is then dried and later cooked in boiling water. Israeli couscous is also a type of pasta but consists of granules that are much larger about the size of small pearls. Made from wheat flour and semolina, Israeli couscous has a ball-like shape and is toasted, rather than dried, after the granules are formed. This process gives Israeli couscous a nuttier flavour and chewy bite that adds an unexpected touch to regional recipes. We offer Israeli couscous, made in the USA, from the finest amber, durum US wheat, thus giving it the premium quality that you can expect. Named for its unique shape, Pearled Couscous (also known as Israeli Couscous or Pearled Pasta) is shaped and rolled into tiny balls and then toasted. This allows the product to absorb liquids and cook up more like rice or risotto. The toasting process gives this product a nutty flavour and satisfying mouthfeel. To prepare it, start by sauteing the couscous in oil. Then add 1 1/4 cups of boiling water and mix the couscous in a pan. Cover and simmer for 8-10 minutes and stir occasionally. Once the water is absorbed, fluff it with a fork and this couscous is ready to serve. One can also combine couscous with oregano, basil, or your own blend of herbs, seasonings, and vegetables.

Noodles originated from china, whence they migrated eastwards to japan and westwards to south Asia. No oriental meal can be complete without noodles. Asian wheat noodles are typically made from low-or moderate - protein flours and are formed not by extrusion but by sheeting and cutting or stretching. The hand-pulled noodles of shanghai (la mian) are a fine example, in which the maker starts with a thick rope of dough, swings, twists and stretches it to an arm’s length, brings the ends together, repeats the process as many as 11 times to make more than 4000 thin noodles. Asian wheat noodles are both elastic and soft, their texture created by their weak gluten and amylopectin - rich starch in the wheat. Salt is an important ingredient in Asian noodles. It tightens the gluten network and stabilizes the starch granules, keeping them intact even as they absorb water and swell. We begin with the meishi white wheat Chinese noodles, ban mian style (Hand cut hakka noodles) - both - broad as well as fine. You may prefer the broad noodles for the ban mian soup and the fine noodles for stir-fry with veggies or meat. The ingredients are wheat flour, salt and water.
