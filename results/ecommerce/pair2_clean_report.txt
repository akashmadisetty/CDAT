TRANSFER LEARNING FRAMEWORK - ANALYSIS REPORT

Domain Pair: Custom: pair2_satisfied_source_RFM → pair2_neutral_target_RFM
Transferability Score: 0.3311


Transfer Learning Recommendation
======================================================================
Transferability Level: VERY_LOW
Composite Score: 0.3311
Confidence: 66.8%

Recommended Strategy: Train From Scratch
Target Data Required: 100%

Reasoning:
Very low transferability (score: 0.3311). Domains are fundamentally different. Transfer learning is not recommended. The source model's knowledge may be irrelevant or even harmful for the target domain. Train a new model from scratch using target data.

Potential Risks:
  • High distribution mismatch - source and target are very different
  • Significant divergence in feature distributions
  • Small target sample size - results may not be representative
  • Limited source data - model may not have learned robust patterns
  • Very low transferability - transfer learning may not be beneficial

Expected Performance:
Transfer not recommended. Training from scratch on 100% target data will likely outperform transferred model. Source domain knowledge does not apply to this target domain.
